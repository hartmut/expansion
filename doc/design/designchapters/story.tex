\section{Start}

You start from earth with minimum volatiles, a small space ship and some building and living basics. Your first goal will be to establish an outpost somwhere around Jupiter or in the astroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. First survive, then try to find out what others need and specialise for this? Or just build a viable colony.

After that there will be system wide challenges where you can participate and you may also expand your outpost. When you have enough material to grow you also may try to build new colonies or probably ships to mine resources, transport material, help others? The only problems is, the more you see of the solar system, the bigger it gets and your curiosity may get you into trouble.
