\section{Start}

You start from earth with minimum volatiles, a small space ship and some building and living basics. 
Your first goal will be to establish an outpost in the astroid belt between Mars and
Jupiter. Try to find out what others need and specialise for this at first. After
that there will be system wide challenges where you can participate and you may expand
your outpost. When you have enough material to grow you also may try to build new colonies or
probably ships to mine resources, transport material, help others?
