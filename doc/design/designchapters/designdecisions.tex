\section{Client / Server}
At first everything will be developed in the server section. 

How to structure the client and server part:
\begin{itemize}
 \item piston 
 \item webclient
\end{itemize}
Exchange of status informations by json or similar protocols.

It should be possible to develop the client independent of the server, just connected
by the structures which are send to the client. This will enable, in a later stage
the distribution of servers (No ideas yet how to prevent cheating).

\subsection{Protocol}

The protocol needs to transport full and delta status informations for every relevant object. 
Performance could get an issue.

For graphicinformations we need a standard protocol for which there exists standard client
and server libraries.

\section{Physic Simulation}
TODO Evaluate use of crate \href{https://github.com/saurvs/astro-rust}{astro} for positions of objects in space.

\subsection{Expansion of World}

\section{Basic structures}
We need decision trees, which will also be helpfull for for production and reseach trees.
