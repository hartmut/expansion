\section{Client / Server}
At first everything will be developed in the server section and the client should just be a display.

Exchange of status informations by json or similar protocols.

It should be possible to develop the client independent of the server, just connected by the structures which are send to the client. This will enable, in a later stage the distribution of servers (No ideas yet how to prevent cheating).

\subsection{Protocol}

The protocol needs to transport full and delta status informations for every relevant object. Performance could get an issue.

For graphicinformations we need a standard protocol for which there exists standard client and server libraries.
